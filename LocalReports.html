                I was then hit by a wave of a very unpleasant odor. It was shockingly similar in smell to cheetos and salami, 
                which is strange because i had consumed an ungodly amount of cheetos and prosciutto the night prior. 
                I don’t understand whats happening to Richmond. I thought i would be safe from these smells in my own home!!

                <b>Location:</b> Thirsty's, in the men's bathroom <br>
                <b>Smell:</b> Initial smell of urine, but also pepperoni pizza mixed with chemically lipstick <br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> At first, I was just taking a piss. Then, a twink and a bear walked into the bathroom and went into a single stall. After that it just started smelling like what I'd describe as a chemically lipstick smell mixed with pepperoni pizza. I don't even think Thirsty's serves pizza. And they certainly did not come in with an entire box of pizza. The chemically lipstick smell is what threw me off, though. They were also being eerily silent in there. Didn't hear a single drop of piss, no sounds of pleasure or anything... just the smell.

                <b>Location:</b> on the 1000 block of franklin street <br>
                <b>Smell:</b> a mixture of something man made and extra terrestrial. 
                earthy, burnt, enough to seemingly singe the nostril hairs<br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> this particular smell was so familiar…. and yet so 
                distant that it’s mere existence in the air rattled me to my core. 
                what could it be?

                <b>Smell:</b> I cannot escape the scent of jalapeño 
                Cheetos combined with body odor and axe spray. It’s destroying me!!!<br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> Many men were seen eating jalapeños and Cheetos
                 maybe that has something to do with it
