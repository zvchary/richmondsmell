                <b>Speculations:</b> No idea, unless I was having a stroke and haven’t realized it yet.
                 Hopefully it was just a downdraft from the sewage treatment plant indicating the beginning
                of pumpkin spice season.

                <b>Location:</b> Outside Zorch Pizza <br>
                <b>Smell:</b> A mix of raw sewage, freshly baked pizza, and basil. Frankly a weird combination that
                I wish I could have investigated more, but I was on my lunch break and had to eat my lunch.   <br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> A zorch employee was picking fresh basil in the window when i walked by, however 
                the raw sewage scent was a mystery. Was it an overflowing toilet? A pile of trash on the side of the street? 
                Was it wafting from the rotting skeleton in the alleyway? Who knows.

                <b>Location:</b> Starr Hill brewery rooftop in Scott’s Addition  <br>
                <b>Smell:</b> Wet hot dumpster <br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> Me and my friend went to grab a seat on the rooftop overlooking the street when 
                we were hit with the most dank trash ass smell ever. We thought maybe there was just a dumpster below 
                us so we moved seats. When we left we walked past where the smell was and there was no dumpster or nothing. 
                Stanky mystery

                <b>Location:</b> My room <br>
                <b>Smell:</b> Kinda like a fart <br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> I woke up around 11am suddenly because of a startling sound similar to flatulence. 
                I was then hit by a wave of a very unpleasant odor. It was shockingly similar in smell to cheetos and salami, 
                which is strange because i had consumed an ungodly amount of cheetos and prosciutto the night prior. 
                I don’t understand whats happening to Richmond. I thought i would be safe from these smells in my own home!!

                <b>Time/Date:</b> Friday, October 11, around 11pm <br>
                <b>Location:</b> Thirsty's, in the men's bathroom <br>
                <b>Smell:</b> Initial smell of urine, but also pepperoni pizza mixed with chemically lipstick <br>
                <b>Speculations:</b> At first, I was just taking a piss. Then, a twink and a bear walked into the bathroom and went into a single stall. After that it just started smelling like what I'd describe as a chemically lipstick smell mixed with pepperoni pizza. I don't even think Thirsty's serves pizza. And they certainly did not come in with an entire box of pizza. The chemically lipstick smell is what threw me off, though. They were also being eerily silent in there. Didn't hear a single drop of piss, no sounds of pleasure or anything... just the smell.
